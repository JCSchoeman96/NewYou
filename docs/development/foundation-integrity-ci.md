# Foundation Integrity CI

This document describes the Foundation Integrity lanes introduced for WELL-38.
The lanes preserve governance certification while separating current routing
checks from the complete historical suite.

## Canonical commands

Run the always-on Smoke lane from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_foundation_smoke.py' -v
python -m tools.foundation_integrity_smoke --manifest docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json --json
```

Run the complete governance and historical certification lane for an exact
checkout:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python tools/foundation_integrity_audit.py --manifest docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json --json
```

Foundation Full runs all discovered tests. No historical test is excluded from
the full command. The manifest-backed full audit continues to check historical
hashes, archive provenance, transition rules and current governance.

For an exact commit on GitHub Actions, run **Foundation Integrity** with the
`workflow_dispatch` input `sha` set to the full 40-character commit SHA and use
the workflow ref whose tip is that same SHA. Both Smoke and Full verify the
workflow ref SHA and checked-out `HEAD` against the input. Dispatch always
selects Foundation Full.

## CI routing

Every pull request and every push to `main` runs Foundation Smoke. The workflow
does not use path filters, so the required status check cannot disappear when
files change.

The route job compares the pull request base to its head, or the push's `before`
to its head. It selects Foundation Full for any non-application path, mixed
application and governance changes, unknown paths, unavailable Git history, or
a manual dispatch. An empty or unresolvable change range also selects Full. An
application-only change is limited to these roots and files:

- `apps/`, `assets/`, `config/`, `lib/`, `priv/`, and `test/`;
- `mix.exs`, `mix.lock`, and `.formatter.exs`.

All other paths, including Python tests under `tests/`, require Foundation
Full. If route calculation fails, the workflow selects Full. The
`foundation-integrity` aggregation job keeps the existing required check
context **Foundation Integrity**: Smoke must pass, and Full must either pass or
be skipped by the route decision.

This ticket does not create an Elixir project or run Mix commands. The
application path classification is the routing boundary for later governed
implementation work. When the application has the corresponding Mix aliases,
its ordinary verification should run `mix check`, followed by `mix check.deep`
for the deeper proof set. Application-only changes do not run the complete
historical governance suite.

## Lane responsibilities

**Foundation Smoke** checks the active authority inventory, current manifest
paths and metadata, current README and working-artifact routes, navigation
paths, and current authority routing. A current route into `archive/`, a
missing current file, a stale README route, or an invalid manifest fails this
lane.

**Foundation Full** runs the complete unit suite and full audit. It retains
historical certification, immutable hash, archive provenance, lifecycle,
transition and fail-closed mutation checks. Smoke does not replace any of
these checks.

## Baseline evidence

The required baseline was checked before restructuring, on exact main SHA
`4234965c8da20dbb4ef0a7128614a5070244619a`:

```text
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
Ran 508 tests in 883.353s
OK

python3 tools/foundation_integrity_audit.py --manifest docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json --json
PASS — 900 assertions, 0 findings
```

The baseline working tree was clean. The baseline SHA was confirmed against
local `main`, `origin/main`, and live `main` before changes.

## Candidate verification

Candidate verification ran from the WELL-38 branch based on the same SHA:

```text
python3 -m compileall -q tools tests
PASS

python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
Ran 521 tests in 874.634s
OK

python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_foundation_smoke.py' -v
Ran 11 tests in 0.302s
OK

python3 tools/foundation_integrity_audit.py --manifest docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json --json
PASS — 900 assertions, 0 findings

python3 -m tools.foundation_integrity_smoke --manifest docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json --json
PASS — 45 assertions, 0 findings

git diff --check HEAD
PASS
```

## Reclassification of PR #133 legacy failures

PR #133's Foundation Integrity run `39547940310` reported 43 failing test
methods and three class setup errors after its legitimate status successor
archived or superseded earlier current files. Those failures fall into the
following preserved categories:

| Previous assertion group | Formerly failing tests | WELL-38 classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read current paths and README routes | `test_explicit_current_routes_in_roadmap_atlas_and_harden_resolve_relationally`; `test_current_routes_are_current_and_old_paths_remain_archived`; `test_current_derived_routes_keep_programme_router_open`; `test_current_derived_routes_reject_open_tracker_projection`; setup in `test_platform_readme_router_consistency`, `test_product_law_hardening`, and `test_roadmap_routing_resilience` | These remain current-state assertions. They now resolve the live path from the manifest or working navigation routes, then test that current file and its relationship to current README/authority routes. A broken current route still fails. |
| Assert PR #126's promoted status at a predecessor's old current path | All methods in `test_fp001_development_entry_hard_stop_promotion` that read Open Work v1.2.77, Atlas v0.4.19, Skeleton v0.1.21, or HARDEN-02 v0.5.21; `test_lifecycle_manifest_and_scope_are_current_and_unchanged`; `test_open_work_routes_to_review_without_advancing_proof_or_phase9` | These assertions certify a completed historical transition. They now read the archived snapshot when present, retain the same status and content checks, and compare the Open Work v1.2.77 bytes with the certified baseline. They no longer assert that the predecessor remains current. |
| Derive fixture paths from the former current version | All failing methods in `test_foundation_integrity_audit`; `test_fail_closed_mutations_use_production_run_audit`; `test_scope_and_candidate_lifecycle_preserve_the_existing_gates`; `test_current_readme_and_open_work_route_tracker_124_as_closed` | Current mutation fixtures now start from manifest-resolved current documents. Assertions aimed at named predecessor provenance use archive snapshots. Mutation rejection, audit failure, and hash checks remain in Foundation Full. |

The 43 formerly failing test methods, grouped by module, were:

- `test_dol_01_marketing_unsubscribe_authority.py`: `test_current_routes_are_current_and_old_paths_remain_archived`, `test_downstream_gate_lines_match_the_preserved_open_work_predecessor`.
- `test_engineering_standards_promotion.py`: `test_fail_closed_mutations_use_production_run_audit`.
- `test_foundation_integrity_audit.py`: `test_explicit_current_routes_in_roadmap_atlas_and_harden_resolve_relationally`, `test_fp001_audit_current_promotion_rejects_misattributed_successor_provenance`, `test_fp001_audit_work_start_predecessors_fail_in_unqualified_active_routes`, `test_fp001_communications_v010_promotion_coherence_guards_fail_closed`, `test_fp001_durable_delivery_attestation_requires_bound_post_merge_comment`, `test_fp001_identity_v014_open_work_separates_pr76_certification_from_pr77_promotion`, `test_fp001_identity_v014_promotion_rejects_lineage_route_and_gate_mutations`, `test_fp001_identity_v014_promotion_rejects_non_immediate_atlas_predecessor`, `test_fp001_phase8_rejects_unreviewed_current_route_text`, `test_fp001_pmr_current_status_successor_artifacts_are_byte_pinned`, `test_fp001_pmr_mutation_matrix_fails_closed`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_atlas_metadata_declarations_outside_header`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_harden_metadata_declarations_outside_header`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_multiple_active_skeleton_versions`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_stale_candidate_path_alongside_certified_successor`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_unarchived_predecessor_route_in_current_atlas`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_unqualified_current_harden_section_20_stop`, `test_fp001_pmr_rejects_unreviewed_additions_to_current_route`, `test_fp001_pmr_validates_atlas_artifact_lineage_independently_of_open_work`, `test_fp001_pmr_validates_harden_v0520_successor_metadata`, `test_harden_execution_state_machine_fixtures`, `test_phase7c_foundation_integrity_rejects_candidate_mutations`, `test_roadmap_proof_classification_lifecycle_fails_closed_on_scope_regressions`.
- `test_fp001_development_entry_hard_stop_promotion.py`: `test_atlas_current_status_has_no_contradictory_authorisation`, `test_atlas_patch_scope_sections_restore_history`, `test_atlas_transition_v0_4_18_to_v0_4_19`, `test_foundation_integrity_rejects_reverted_hard_stop_state`, `test_foundation_integrity_rejects_stale_current_atlas_jit_boundary`, `test_hard_stop_pass_authorises_bounded_phase8_only`, `test_harden_current_predecessor_and_section_20_authority_are_unambiguous`, `test_harden_current_sections_do_not_project_pre_hard_stop_state`, `test_harden_historical_pre_classification_record_is_preserved`, `test_skeleton_current_status_is_pass_bounded_and_not_pre_hard_stop`, `test_skeleton_direct_predecessor_is_v0_1_20`, `test_skeleton_historical_sections_match_archived_v0_1_17`, `test_unauthorised_state_rejects_identical_synthetic_source`.
- `test_fp001_phase7b_reconciliation_candidate.py`: `test_scope_and_candidate_lifecycle_preserve_the_existing_gates`.
- `test_fp001_phase7c_final_contract_candidate.py`: `test_current_readme_and_open_work_route_tracker_124_as_closed`.
- `test_fp001_tracker_closure_sync.py`: `test_current_derived_routes_keep_programme_router_open`, `test_current_derived_routes_reject_open_tracker_projection`.

The three class setup errors were `setUpClass` in `test_platform_readme_router_consistency.py`, `test_product_law_hardening.py`, and `test_roadmap_routing_resilience.py`; each loaded an old current path directly and now obtains the current route from the manifest.

Additional nearby lifecycle assertions were made successor-safe even though
they were not among those 43 failures: the current README/manifest checks in
`test_fp001_phase7c_current_promotion.py` and
`test_fp001_audit_evidence_v010_promotion.py` now resolve current routes
dynamically; PR #121's Open Work v1.2.77 status check in
`test_fp001_phase7b_reconciliation_certification.py` is explicitly historical
and byte-pinned to baseline; and the Phase 8 proof-contract lifecycle test reads
the v1.2.77 status snapshot from its active or archived location.

Prior Architecture, Domain, Roadmap and HARDEN-02 certification tests also
pinned the old workflow bytes as a current artifact. They now verify that exact
workflow remains in the WELL-38 base commit history, while Foundation Smoke
tests the changed live workflow and routing. The earlier scope guard permits
only the WELL-38 CI files and test support in addition to its existing paths;
it still rejects application/bootstrap files and unrelated governance paths.

## Historical-only evidence retained

The following status assertions are intentionally historical-only: PR #126's
Open Work v1.2.77, Delivery Atlas v0.4.19, FP-001 Skeleton v0.1.21, and
HARDEN-02 v0.5.21 transition state. Their exact text, route history, gate
status, and byte provenance remain checked. Tests for earlier candidate
archives and lifecycle promotions remain part of the full suite and audit.
The reviewed TB-001 contract archive is accepted only when the Phase 8
manifest rule and historical manifest record pin the same immutable bytes;
other unregistered Tracer Bullet or architectural-proof artifacts still fail.
No Product, Architecture, Domain, Roadmap, TB-001, or Feature Pack semantics
were changed, and no historical evidence was deleted.
