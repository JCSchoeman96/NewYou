NewYou Engineering Contract

This file is manually owned by NewYou. Generated framework documentation never replaces it.

Development workflow

- Make all changes on a git branch.
- Use an isolated worktree where appropriate.
- Create a PR for implementation or repository changes so they can be reviewed.
- Do not merge unless explicitly authorised.
- After merge and local sync, leave the repository clean and ready for the next agent.

Authority and execution sources

GitHub is canonical for durable governance and implementation evidence.

Plane project "WELL" is canonical for live execution state beneath that law: work-item state, priority, blockers, dependencies, sequencing, acceptance criteria, discovered work and review/merge readiness.

For current durable routing start with:

1. "docs/00_platform/README.md"
2. "docs/00_platform/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_ROUTER_v1.0.0.json"

Use router "deep_reference_documents" only when exact source or identifier tracing is required.

"CURRENT_AUTHORITY_MANIFEST_v1.0.0.json" is frozen historical/provenance input for Foundation Full, not the live delivery router.

"docs/00_platform/02_OPEN_WORK_v1.2.90.md" is frozen legacy evidence, not live execution authority.

Durable authority order is:

Product Law → Architecture Law → Domain Law → governing Roadmap → applicable supporting authority → semantic Feature/JIT/proof contracts where required → implementation.

Plane never overrides durable GitHub law. If Plane and durable authority conflict, STOP only the affected work, record the evidence in Plane and reconcile the smallest correct upstream authority.

Working or derived artifacts such as Delivery Atlas, Skeleton, HARDEN, JIT dossiers and proof contracts change only when their semantic contract changes. Status-only changes belong in Plane.

Durable governance is read-only during ordinary implementation. Amend it only for a deliberate durable semantic change or a proven upstream governance contradiction.

Delivery modes

NewYou has two distinct delivery modes.

New vertical slice or substantial feature

Use proportional planning:

"reconnaissance → /grilling when materially needed → to-spec only when durable semantics are missing → to-tickets when decomposition helps → Plane"

Do not force every slice through every ceremony.

A "/grilling" may conclude that current authority is sufficient and the remaining decisions are JIT implementation choices.

Ready implementation ticket

Fresh implementation starts only from a dependency-cleared Plane ticket in "Ready".

"Ready" means there is sufficient durable direction and executable acceptance criteria to implement, while leaving normal engineering design to JIT development.

It does not mean every Resource, table, field, action, constraint, transaction mechanism or internal representation has already been designed.

Before implementing a Ready ticket, invoke the packaged `$ticket-implement` skill, then identify the NewYou Plane ticket to implement.

Do not routinely invoke "/grilling", "to-spec" or "to-tickets" again inside a Ready ticket.

A Ready ticket can still uncover genuinely new information. Discovery alone does not make the ticket blocked.

Plane execution boundary

Only "Ready" authorises a fresh implementation agent to begin a ticket.

- "Backlog", "Planning" and "Blocked" are not executable.
- "In Progress", "In Review", "Changes Requested", "Ready to Merge" and "Merging" describe work already in progress.
- "Done" is terminal only after required post-merge/resulting-main reconciliation.

Before dispatch or implementation, reverify:

- the ticket is still "Ready";
- blockers and dependencies are resolved;
- acceptance criteria remain coherent and executable;
- current "main" has not invalidated the ticket;
- no already-known upstream contradiction exists.

After the readiness gate passes and immediately before implementation begins, move the ticket:

"Ready → In Progress"

When the implementation PR is opened and ready for independent review, move it:

"In Progress → In Review"

Search Plane before creating work. Do not create duplicates.

All material delivery work belongs in Plane, including executable work, blockers/dependencies, defects, discovered work, security/privacy concerns and release/proof gaps.

Do not leave delivery-affecting work only in chat, PR comments, TODOs, handoff notes or memory.

Keep Plane focused on active delivery and near-term executable work. Do not pre-create speculative future tasks.

Reconnaissance

Before "/grilling", "to-spec", "to-tickets" or material implementation, inspect the relevant live state:

1. "docs/00_platform/README.md" and the current authority router;
2. applicable durable Product/Decision, Architecture, Domain, Roadmap and supporting authority;
3. relevant semantic Feature/JIT/proof contracts;
4. live Plane work, blockers, dependencies and acceptance criteria;
5. actual code, tests, migrations and dependency versions.

Follow evidence only as far as the task requires. Do not load the entire historical archive by default.

Do not re-grill, re-spec or re-ticket settled decisions without new evidence, changed scope or a proven contradiction.

JIT implementation decision model

NewYou deliberately uses just-in-time implementation design.

Governance defines durable outcomes, ownership, invariants, externally meaningful lifecycle semantics, security/privacy/safety boundaries, cross-Domain rules and explicit prohibitions.

It is not expected to pre-specify every internal engineering mechanism.

Classify material questions as follows.

"LOCKED"

Current durable authority answers the material business or architectural question.

Follow it.

"JIT IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE"

This is the default classification for implementation detail not fixed by durable authority.

When authority defines the required outcome and boundaries but leaves the mechanism open, choose the simplest compliant implementation, test it and continue.

Examples include, where not otherwise locked:

- a private Domain-owned Resource or extension to an existing Resource;
- tables, fields and internal attributes;
- Ash actions, changes, validations and code interfaces;
- identities, indexes and database constraints;
- transaction composition;
- concurrency/arbitration mechanisms;
- idempotency implementation;
- retention or tombstone mechanisms required to satisfy an existing invariant;
- internal modules and helper boundaries;
- migration shape;
- internal result/error representation;
- selection among compliant framework mechanisms.

A private implementation Resource does not become new business authority merely because it is durable.

The absence of an implementation detail from governance does not mean governance is incomplete.

Material JIT choices become durable through code, migrations and constraints where applicable, tests, and Plane/PR evidence.

Do not amend Product, Architecture, Domain, Roadmap or semantic contracts merely to record an implementation choice.

"UPSTREAM GOVERNANCE CONTRADICTION"

This classification is exceptional.

Use it only when implementation cannot proceed correctly without changing or inventing a material durable semantic such as:

- Domain/business ownership;
- externally meaningful lifecycle behaviour;
- authorization or entitlement;
- security/privacy/safety requirements;
- legal, clinical or commercial policy;
- cross-Domain authority;
- another expensive-to-reverse invariant that belongs above implementation.

A missing Resource, table, field, action, index, retention mechanism, transaction strategy or framework choice is not by itself an upstream contradiction.

Before blocking for governance, demonstrate all three:

1. the exact governing statements that conflict or are insufficient;
2. why no reasonable compliant JIT implementation can satisfy them;
3. the material durable semantic that would otherwise have to be invented or changed.

If all three cannot be demonstrated, continue as a "JIT IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE".

When a genuine contradiction exists, STOP only the affected work, record exact evidence in Plane and escalate the smallest correct upstream authority.

Implementation presumption

For a dependency-cleared "Ready" ticket:

Prefer implementation over governance amendment.

Do not re-grill, re-spec, create governance successors, block a ticket or wait for Foundation Full merely because implementation revealed an unspecified engineering detail.

Do not ask the human to choose between ordinary compliant implementation alternatives. Evaluate the alternatives and select the simplest compliant design.

Ask or escalate only when the unresolved choice would materially change a durable or expensive-to-reverse semantic.

Implementation discipline

For a Ready ticket:

1. reverify Plane state and dependencies;
2. inspect relevant authority and actual code/tests/migrations/dependencies;
3. identify the existing implementation seam;
4. classify unresolved questions as "LOCKED", "JIT IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE" or "UPSTREAM GOVERNANCE CONTRADICTION";
5. make the necessary JIT engineering decisions;
6. create a focused implementation plan against actual code;
7. implement ticket scope using test-first development;
8. run applicable repository verification;
9. update Plane and open a PR with exact evidence.

Stay inside ticket scope. Do not opportunistically implement adjacent features or Domains.

Use Igniter first for supported structural or package changes. Hand-edit where Igniter does not safely support the change.

Use Tidewave/runtime evidence where it answers development questions better than static reading. Tidewave is diagnostic tooling, never business authority.

Required skills

Use the installed `$ticket-implement` skill before fresh Ready-ticket implementation. The package also provides `project-implementation` as a compatibility skill for existing references.

The repo-local `project-implementation` path remains only as a thin shim for the pinned TB-001 reference. It must delegate to the packaged workflow.

Do not add repo-local copies of the packaged workflows or define a competing implementation procedure.

Before implementation involving Ash-backed behaviour or durable state, load the relevant Ash skill/reference.

Before handoff or merge recommendation use:

".agents/skills/code-change-verification/SKILL.md"

Load other generated framework skills only when relevant.

Ash-first mechanism selection

Ash is the default application framework.

For implementation involving business behaviour, durable state, authorization, authentication, lifecycle, history, async work, audit/evidence, cross-Domain coordination or Ash-backed web flows:

1. load ".agents/skills/ash-framework/SKILL.md" and relevant generated references;
2. evaluate the Ash capabilities that materially match the requirement;
3. verify current APIs and compatibility against official primary sources;
4. prefer a fitting Ash mechanism over bespoke Elixir/Ecto/OTP plumbing when it satisfies the requirement without violating authority;
5. record material selections where useful as "USE", "NOT APPLICABLE", "DEFER" or "BLOCKED / NEEDS AUTHORITY".

Evaluate relevant core Resources/actions/interfaces, policies, identities/constraints and applicable extensions such as AshPostgres, AshAuthentication, AshPhoenix, AshOban, AshStateMachine, Signals, Temporal Resources, Cloak or history/archive tooling only when their capability materially matches the ticket.

For cross-Domain reactions or event-like coordination, explicitly consider Ash Signals.

For historical/as-of/effective-period requirements, explicitly consider Temporal Resources.

Neither Signals nor Temporal Resources becomes business authority merely because it is technically useful.

Evaluation is not installation authority. A new dependency requires a concrete need, compatibility with the current stack, current stable-version/API verification and any required Architecture/Security/Domain approval.

Re-evaluate material framework choices at implementation time when versions, capabilities, scope or authority have changed since planning.

Domain and persistence invariants

Every durable business truth has exactly one authoritative Domain owner.

Cross-Domain mutation goes through the owning Domain/Ash interface.

Derived state, caches, Analytics, search indexes, provider state, PubSub and UI projections never become business authority.

Business writes use owning Ash interfaces. Controllers, LiveViews and workers call the owning Domain/application interface.

Do not introduce parallel ordinary "NewYou.Repo", raw SQL or "Ecto.Multi" business-write APIs. "mix check.architecture" enforces these boundaries.

Do not introduce Redis, extra services, extra Repos, ETS/process authority, replicas, Rust/Rustler, microservices or speculative infrastructure without demonstrated need and authority.

Authorization and capability authority

Resolve authorization through governed roles, scopes and applicable relationships.

Capabilities belong to governed roles/scopes/relationships. Named people may receive explicit grants; they never define capability authority.

Do not attach a business capability directly to a named user as a shortcut. Treat that as an upstream governance contradiction.

Governed bootstrap may establish initial explicit role/scope grants, but bootstrap itself holds no business capability. After bootstrap, sensitive grants require the appropriate role-based independent approver, distinct from the subject.

Multiple valid roles on one identity are expected and supported.

Platform Administrator, developer or founder status does not imply expert Domain authority.

Super Admin is break-glass, not a universal bypass.

An unresolved required approver authority is a STOP condition.

Lifecycle requirements

Every meaningful lifecycle must explicitly cover, as applicable:

- states;
- transitions;
- guards and invariants;
- side effects;
- terminal states;
- authorization;
- concurrency;
- idempotency;
- retries;
- failure behaviour;
- restart/recovery/reconciliation.

Lifecycle correctness must be enforced by the owning durable authority, not process-local state.

Defects and regression proof

Every material bug, security issue or behavioural regression must leave permanent regression coverage.

Where technically possible:

1. reproduce it with a focused failing automated test;
2. implement the fix;
3. prove the regression test passes;
4. run applicable wider verification.

If deterministic automation is genuinely impossible, record the reason and strongest repeatable alternative proof in Plane.

A material defect fix without adequate regression proof is not complete.

Evidence

Do not guess material framework or package APIs.

Prefer evidence in this order:

1. current repository authority and implementation;
2. relevant generated framework skills;
3. runtime/Tidewave evidence;
4. version-matched official HexDocs/source;
5. model memory last.

Verify current stable package/API facts and distinguish stable releases from prerelease or main-branch documentation.

Verification, review and merge

"mix check" is the canonical fast engineering gate.

"mix check.deep" is the slower engineering gate.

Foundation Smoke runs on every PR and validates current routing and merge-gate topology.

Application CI runs for routed engineering changes.

Foundation Full is historical/provenance certification for applicable governance/provenance/workflow changes plus nightly/manual exact-SHA certification. It is not a routine implementation gate.

The operational CI topology is documented in:

"docs/development/foundation-integrity-merge-gate.md"

Do not wait for non-blocking Foundation Full unless explicitly required.

Ordinary JIT implementation choices do not justify governance amendments merely to obtain Foundation Full evidence.

Investigate any material CI or Foundation Full failure caused by the current PR even when that lane is non-blocking.

Before handoff:

- verify the complete diff;
- verify the exact head SHA;
- run applicable tests/checks;
- verify current Plane state;
- create or update the PR;
- provide exact evidence for independent review.

The implementing agent does not self-certify merge authority and does not silently merge.

Master Gate independently verifies the exact PR head, complete diff, durable authority, live Plane acceptance contract, scope, ownership, lifecycle, persistence, concurrency/idempotency, retries/failure/recovery, security/privacy/safety, dependency/API correctness, tests and exact-head CI.

Master Gate reviews JIT implementation choices for correctness and compliance. It must not reject a compliant internal engineering choice merely because governance did not pre-specify it.

A reviewer claiming an upstream governance contradiction must satisfy the same three-part contradiction test before blocking integration.

Any reviewed-head change invalidates prior certification.

Merge alone does not complete delivery. Verify resulting-main SHA/tree, candidate integration/no drift and required resulting-main CI/proof before moving Plane to "Done" or opening dependent work.

Local DevCore credentials

DO NOT ASK THE USER FOR LOCAL DB PASSWORDS OR DEVCORE-MANAGED DB VARIABLES.

If ".devcore/project.conf" exists:

1. run "devcore-project doctor";
2. if state is missing or stale, run "devcore-project activate";
3. run DB-dependent commands with:
   - "devcore-project run dev -- <command>"
   - "devcore-project run test -- <command>"

Never request or print password values.

The repository must not start, stop, recreate or delete shared DevCore services or volumes.

Redis is not used by NewYou.

Both PostgreSQL roles must remain "NOCREATEDB".
